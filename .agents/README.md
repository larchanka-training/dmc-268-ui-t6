# .agents

## Layout decision

`.agents/` is the source of truth for agent rules, skills, and agent definitions
in both `dmc-268-ui-t6` and `dmc-268-api-t6`. Harness-specific paths are symlinks
onto it, not copies: `.claude/skills -> ../.agents/skills` and
`.claude/agents -> ../.agents/agents` (created in T2 of this issue — treat them
as present).

Rationale: the course board's Definition of Ready/Done, `docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`
§15 (OQ-4), and the 2026-08-17 lecture all converge on `.agents/` over
`docs/agents/`. Codex reads `.agents/skills` natively; Claude Code reads
`.claude/skills` — the symlink lets one file tree serve both without
duplication.

## Harness matrix

| Harness     | Reads                        | Notes                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills` (symlink)   | native skill discovery               |
| Codex       | `.agents/skills`             | native, no symlink needed            |
| Cursor      | `AGENTS.md` (pending role 1) | manual `@`-reference to `.agents/**` |
| Gemini CLI  | `AGENTS.md` (pending role 1) | manual `@`-reference to `.agents/**` |
| Copilot     | `AGENTS.md` (pending role 1) | manual reference — verify per tool   |

## Directory map

- `rules/` — stack and workflow rules (`frontend.md`, `git-workflow.md`).
- `skills/` — agent skills, one `SKILL.md` per directory.
- `agents/` — agent definitions (`name`, `description`, `model` frontmatter).
- `templates/` — code/test templates with proof blocks.
- `proposals/` — drafts owned by other roles (e.g. `agents-md-draft.md`).

## Sync map (ui ↔ api)

These files are byte-identical between the two repos, marked with a
`<!-- SYNC: mirrored in dmc-268-{ui,api}-t6/.agents/<path> -->` line:

- `rules/git-workflow.md`
- `skills/agent-loop/**`, `skills/code-review/**`, `skills/pull-request/**`,
  `skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/**`, `skills/qa/**`
- `agents/*.md`

Everything else (`rules/frontend.md` / `rules/backend.md`, stack-specific
skills, `templates/`) is per-repo.

## How to add a skill

Each `skills/<dir>/SKILL.md` needs frontmatter: `name` (matches the directory),
`description` (third person, "This skill should be used when…"), and a
`metadata` block (`version: 1.0.0`, `source: instructor-pack`,
`adapted-for: frontend|backend|any`). Budget: keep each skill file under
~150 lines; write it in English.

## Product review prompts

The review prompts and rule sets for the AI reviewer product live in
`dmc-268-api-t6/review/` (role 7), not in this directory — `.agents/` covers
how _we_ build, not what the bot reviews.

## AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` is owned by role 1 — see `proposals/agents-md-draft.md` for the
draft this repo contributes.
