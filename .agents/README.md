# .agents

## Layout decision

`.agents/` is the source of truth for agent rules, skills, and agent definitions
in both `dmc-268-ui-t6` and `dmc-268-api-t6`. Harness-specific paths are symlinks
onto it, not copies: `.claude/skills -> ../.agents/skills` and
`.claude/agents -> ../.agents/agents` (committed as symlink objects).

Rationale: the course board's Definition of Ready/Done, `docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md`
§15 (OQ-4), and the 2026-08-17 lecture all converge on `.agents/` over
`docs/agents/`. Codex reads `.agents/skills` natively; Claude Code reads
`.claude/skills` — the symlink lets one file tree serve both without
duplication. This is role 7's decision, pending ratification by role 1
(tech lead); see `proposals/agents-md-draft.md`.

## Harness matrix

| Harness     | Reads                                         | Notes                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills`, `.claude/agents` (symlinks) | skills + agents via symlinks; rules only via skill links or `AGENTS.md`                                                |
| Codex       | `.agents/skills`                              | skills only; `agents/` is not loaded (Codex agents are `.codex/agents/*.toml`); rules via `AGENTS.md` (pending role 1) |
| Cursor      | `AGENTS.md` (pending role 1)                  | manual `@`-reference to `.agents/**`                                                                                   |
| Gemini CLI  | `AGENTS.md` (pending role 1)                  | manual `@`-reference to `.agents/**`                                                                                   |
| Copilot     | `AGENTS.md` (pending role 1)                  | manual reference — verify per tool                                                                                     |

## Sub-agents across harnesses

Skills and agents here name Claude Code's sub-agent tools. The equivalent per harness:

- **Claude Code** — the `Agent` tool (`subagent_type: general-purpose`, or `Explore` for
  read-only exploration).
- **Codex** — `spawn_agent` with a self-contained message and no inherited history. Default
  `multi_agent` (v1, on by default): `fork_context: false` or omit it; with `multi_agent_v2`:
  `fork_turns: "none"` (its default is `all`).
- **No sub-agent tool** — run each independent check as a separate fresh session
  (`codex exec --ephemeral "<prompt>"` or `claude -p "<prompt>"`) and bring back only its
  verdict. Never run the checks one after another in the same session — that defeats the
  clean context the skills rely on.

## Directory map

- `rules/` — stack and workflow rules (`frontend.md`, `git-workflow.md`).
- `skills/` — agent skills, one `SKILL.md` per directory.
- `agents/` — agent definitions (`name`, `description`, `model` frontmatter).
- `templates/` — code/test templates with proof blocks. Fenced blocks
  preceded by `<!-- proof: <file> -->` were proved once, at authoring time,
  against `main@db5cf78` (lint/typecheck/tests) with role 7's local gate (not in
  this repo); ui: file name under one root; api: `app/…` or `tests/…` prefix
  selects the root. Nothing re-checks them; re-prove after dependency bumps.
- `proposals/` — drafts owned by other roles (e.g. `agents-md-draft.md`).

## Sync map (ui ↔ api)

These files are byte-identical between the two repos, marked with a
`<!-- SYNC: mirrored in dmc-268-{ui,api}-t6/.agents/<path> -->` line:

- `rules/git-workflow.md`
- `skills/agent-loop/**`, `skills/code-review/**`, `skills/pull-request/**`,
  `skills/planning-and-task-breakdown/**`, `skills/qa/**`
- `agents/*.md`

Everything else (`rules/frontend.md` / `rules/backend.md`, stack-specific
skills, `templates/`) is per-repo.

Shared files: edit in `dmc-268-ui-t6`, `cp` to `dmc-268-api-t6`, then
`diff -r` the two paths to confirm byte-identity before committing either.

## How to add a skill

Each `skills/<dir>/SKILL.md` needs frontmatter: `name` (matches the directory),
`description` (third person, "This skill should be used when…"), and a
`metadata` block (`version: 1.0.0`, `source: instructor-pack`,
`adapted-for: frontend|backend|any`). Budget scales with the source: about
1.3× the instructor-pack original plus frontmatter; see existing `SKILL.md`
files for precedent (templates ≤150 lines). Write it in English.

## Product review prompts

The review prompts and rule sets for the AI reviewer product live in
`dmc-268-api-t6/review/` (role 7), not in this directory — `.agents/` covers
how _we_ build, not what the bot reviews.

## AGENTS.md

`AGENTS.md` is owned by role 1 — see `proposals/agents-md-draft.md` for the
draft this repo contributes.
